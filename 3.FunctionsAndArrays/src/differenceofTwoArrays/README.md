# Difference Of Two Arrays

1. You are given a number n1, representing the size of array a1. <br>
2. You are given n1 numbers, representing elements of array a1. <br>
3. You are given a number n2, representing the size of array a2. <br>
4. You are given n2 numbers, representing elements of array a2. <br>
5. The two arrays represent digits of two numbers. <br>
6. You are required to find the difference of two numbers represented by two arrays and print the arrays. a2 - a1 <br>

## Assumption - <br>
number represented by a2 is greater.
## Input Format
A number n1 <br>
n1 number of elements line separated <br>
A number n2 <br>
n2 number of elements line separated <br>
## Output Format
A number representing difference of two numbers (a2 - a1), represented by two arrays.

## Constraints
1 <= n1, n2 <= 100 <br>
0 <= a1[i], a2[i] < 10 <br>
number reresented by a1 is smaller than number represented by a2 <br>
